## Overview

This repository contains the source code for a JavaFX-based Quiz Application. It provides a user-friendly interface for taking quizzes on various topics. The application is built using Maven for dependency management and build automation.

## Features (Based on inferred functionality)

* **User Authentication:** (Likely) Allows users to log in and potentially register.
* **Multiple Quiz Categories:** (Potentially) Supports quizzes on different subjects or topics.
* **Interactive Quiz Interface:** Presents questions with multiple-choice options.
* **Real-time Feedback:** (Potentially) Provides immediate feedback on answers.
* **Score Calculation:** Automatically calculates the user's score upon quiz completion.
* **Results Display:** Shows the user their performance, including correct and incorrect answers.
* **User Profile:** (Potentially) Allows users to view and manage their profile information.
* **Leaderboard:** (Potentially) Displays a ranking of users based on their scores.
* **Database Integration:** Stores user data, quiz questions, and results in a database.

## Technologies Used

* **Java:** The primary programming language.
* **JavaFX:** A GUI toolkit for building desktop applications.
* **Maven:** A build automation and dependency management tool.
* **(Likely) Database:** MySQL or a similar relational database (inferred from common Java application setups).
* **(Potentially) JDBC:** For database connectivity.

## Prerequisites

Before running the application, ensure you have the following installed:

* **Java Development Kit (JDK):** Version 8 or higher is recommended.
* **Maven:** Download and install Maven from [https://maven.apache.org/download.cgi](https://maven.apache.org/download.cgi).
* **(Likely) Database:** If the application uses a database, ensure it is installed and running (e.g., MySQL). You might need to create a database schema and user for the application.

## Setup and Installation

1.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone [https://github.com/prem1310/Quiz-Application.git](https://github.com/prem1310/Quiz-Application.git)
    cd Quiz-Application
    ```

2.  **Build the application using Maven:**
    ```bash
    mvn clean install
    ```
    This command will download dependencies and build the application's JAR file. The JAR file will typically be located in the `QuizApp/target/` directory.

3.  **(Database Configuration - Likely Required):**
    * Set up your database (e.g., MySQL).
    * Create a database named `quizapp_db` (or as configured in the application).
    * Create a user with the necessary privileges to access the database.
    * **(Important)** You will likely need to configure the database connection details (URL, username, password) within the application's configuration files (e.g., in a properties file or within the Java code). Look for files in the `src/main/resources/` directory or within the Java source code.

## Running the Application

1.  Navigate to the `QuizApp/target/` directory.
2.  Run the application using the generated JAR file:
    ```bash
    java -jar quizapp-1.0-SNAPSHOT.jar
    ```
    (Replace `quizapp-1.0-SNAPSHOT.jar` with the actual name of your JAR file).

## Usage

Provide a brief overview of how to use the application. For example:

1.  Launch the application.
2.  Log in with your credentials or register as a new user.
3.  Browse the available quiz categories.
4.  Select a quiz to begin.
5.  Answer the questions presented on the screen.
6.  Submit your answers to see your score and results.
7.  (If implemented) View your profile or the leaderboard.
